        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Hello! I am Kelvin He. I will be joining the Thinkful Program from my current location in New York City.
        </p>
        <p>
         Aside from my interest in coding, I like:
          <ul>
            <li>Cooking and creating recipes.</li>
            <li>Expanding my palette by trying new things.</li>
            <li>Sitting back and enjoying time with friends.</li>
            <li>Traveling to new places to take in the culture.</li>
          </ul>

        <h3>About Kelvin</h3>
        <p>After graduating from the University at Buffalo, I became an EMT during the onset of COVID-19. Throughout that time, I learned a great deal about the necessity of teamwork to overcome hurdles. Unfortunately, after an injury, I had to stop working as an EMT but I found myself in another front-facing job at a nightclub. Even though I was comfortable there, I always had a desire to further my education and I felt as if my mind was becoming stagnant so I decided to pursue a childhood interest of mine.</p>
        <p>Since I was a teenager, I always had an interest in technology. I enjoyed gaming, browsing internet forums, building computers, and I even participated in my high school robotics club. I see learning at Thinkful to be an opportunity to reconnect with a past passion while securing a future in an industry with growth.
